# Overview

The goal of this repository is to have a base working project with Google authentication setup in ASP.NET Core, but without MVC, just Web API.

This comes out of frustration about all blog posts I've found saying "look it's super easy to setup". Yes but they all use MVC, with ton of magic happening under the hood that I don't understand how neither why it works.

It also comes out of frustration for the countless failed attempts to have Web API working with Google authentication I've tried in the past.

Since most of my past and future projects with ASP.NET Core require authentication, and getting authentication in ASP.NET Core Web API to work correctly is actually a pain in the ass, I want to make a project with all setup working, as a reference, or "template".

Target is .NET Core 2.2

# Reason

The reason I want it to work with Web API is because usually I just need an extremely simple HTML file with a few lines a JavaScript as the frontend and don't need tons of Angular or React on the frontend nor Views on the backend. I like to keep things super simple when I don't need more.

So, the base code for this repository is the outcome of

```sh
dotnet new webapi
```
